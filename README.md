# SSW599-SmartCities-BostonParking
Our project seeks to alleviate the persistent challenge of finding parking in Boston by leveraging real-time data through an open-source Boston Parking API, providing users with accurate information on public parking spaces to enhance decision-making and mitigate traffic congestion and frustration.
Link to API: https://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/boston::parking-meters/about
After running the SSW599BostonParking.py file, an interactive map with popup should appear within the folder structure and allow you to see a map of all of the Boston Parking meters
