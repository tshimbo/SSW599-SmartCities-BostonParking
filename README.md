# SSW599-SmartCities-BostonParking

Our project seeks to alleviate the persistent challenge of finding parking in Boston by leveraging real-time data through an open-source Boston Parking API, providing users with accurate information on public parking spaces to enhance decision-making and mitigate traffic congestion and frustration.
